# Josephus-Problem
The well known Josephus Problem, coded in Fortran 95

# Description
A generalization of this problem is as follows. We suppose that every mth person will be executed from a group of size n, in which the pth person is the survivor. If there is an addition of x people to the circle, then the survivor is in the p + mx-th position if this is less than or equal to $n + x$. If x is the smallest value for which (p + mx) > (n + x), then the survivor is in position (p + mx) âˆ’ (n + x).
